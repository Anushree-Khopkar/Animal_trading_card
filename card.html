			<p>Tigers originate from the Asian continent and are not native to Africa as is often believed. There are Chinese and Bengal tigers that have been resettled into Africa.These animals are commonly released from zoos and introduced for the purpose of extending the survival and habitat of their species. Tigers live long whether you find them in the wild or in the confines of a zoo.  </p>
